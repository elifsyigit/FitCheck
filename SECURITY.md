# Security Implementation for FitCheck Firebase Configuration

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented to ensure 100% secure Firebase configuration for the FitCheck Chrome extension.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Origin Validation**
- Only requests from whitelisted Chrome extension origins are allowed
- Dynamic CORS headers based on validated origin
- Prevents unauthorized access from malicious websites

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
- Maximum 10 requests per 5-minute window per IP address
- Automatic cleanup of old rate limit entries
- Prevents abuse and DoS attacks

### 3. **No Hardcoded Fallback Configuration**
- Removed all hardcoded Firebase configuration from client-side code
- Extension will fail securely if unable to retrieve configuration
- Prevents exposure of sensitive configuration data

### 4. **Comprehensive Logging**
- All requests are logged with IP, origin, and user agent
- Security events (unauthorized access, rate limiting) are logged
- Error logging for monitoring and debugging

### 5. **Environment Variable Validation**
- All required Firebase configuration must be set as environment variables
- Server returns error if any required variables are missing
- No default/fallback values for sensitive configuration

### 6. **Restrictive Manifest Permissions**
- Only necessary host permissions are granted
- Removed unused Firebase function URLs
- Minimal CSP (Content Security Policy) configuration

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id_here
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id_here
```

### Security Configuration
```bash
# Add your extension IDs (comma-separated)
ALLOWED_EXTENSION_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://cakcomphgnphkgkpekjjolnjnigmfkce,chrome-extension://your-dev-extension-id

# Rate limiting (optional - defaults provided)
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=300
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW=10
```

## Deployment Security Checklist

1. ✅ Set all required environment variables
2. ✅ Update `ALLOWED_EXTENSION_ORIGINS` with your extension IDs
3. ✅ Deploy Firebase function with proper IAM permissions
4. ✅ Test with unauthorized origins (should be blocked)
5. ✅ Test rate limiting functionality
6. ✅ Verify logging is working correctly
7. ✅ Test extension functionality with secure configuration

## Monitoring

Monitor the following logs for security events:
- Unauthorized origin attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Missing environment variables
- General error conditions

## Security Benefits

1. **Zero Configuration Exposure**: No sensitive data in client-side code
2. **Origin Validation**: Only authorized extensions can access configuration
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail of all requests
5. **Fail-Safe Design**: Extension fails securely if configuration unavailable
6. **Minimal Attack Surface**: Restrictive permissions and CSP

## Next Steps for Production

1. Set up proper monitoring and alerting for security events
2. Consider implementing Redis for distributed rate limiting
3. Add request signing for additional authentication
4. Implement IP whitelisting if needed
5. Set up automated security scanning
